# Introduction
As a Data Engineer at Jarvis Consulting, I conducted a Proof of Concept (PoC) for London Gift Shop (LGS), a UK-based retailer. This project bridges the gap between raw transactional data and actionable marketing insights using a Docker-based ETL and analytics pipeline. By transitioning LGS from generic sales tactics to data-driven strategies, this analysis enables precision targeting for customer acquisition and retention.

Work and Technologies: I am developing an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) and analytics pipeline using Python and Pandas for data manipulation, and Numpy for numerical analysis. My entire workflow is managed within Jupyter Notebooks, and I am using Docker to maintain a consistent environment across the project.

# Implementation
## Project Architecture
The architecture is designed to be decoupled from the LGS production environment to meet security requirements.It utilizes a Docker-based setup where a PostgreSQL container stores the sanitized transaction data, and a Jupyter container serves as the development interface. These containers communicate via a bridge network, allowing me to process the SQL dump provided by the LGS IT team without touching their live Azure cloud.

## Data Analytics and Wrangling
I am using the data to perform RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) Segmentation, which is the primary strategy for increasing revenue.
The primary analytical framework used is RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) segmentation, which categorizes customers based on their historical behavior.
 
#### Recency:
1. Recency: Measures the days since the customer's last purchase.
2. Calculation: We establish a snapshot_date (assumed Jan 1, 2012) and subtract the customer's most recent purchase date from it.
3. Marketing Significance: Low recency indicates active engagement, while high recency signals "At-Risk" or "Hibernating" status.

#### Frequency
1. Measures how often a customer completes a transaction.
2. Calculation: Uses the nunique function on invoice IDs to count unique checkout events rather than total items purchased.
3. Marketing Significance: High frequency identifies "Habitual Buyers" who should be targeted with loyalty incentives.

#### Monetary
1. Measures the total revenue generated by a customer.
2. Calculation: Derived from line_total ($Quantity \times UnitPrice$).
3. Marketing Significance: Distinguishes between "Whale" customers (High M) and small retail hobbyists (Low M).

## Our Case RFM 

1. Champions
RFM Score: 545
Count: 837 customers
Recency (Mean): 7.56 days
Frequency (Mean): 19.34 purchases
Monetary (Mean): £10,901.13

Marketing Strategy: High-value engines of revenue. Prioritize retention over acquisition. Deploy VIP rewards, early access to new products, and personalized "thank you" gestures. Treat as brand advocates.

2. Can't Lose
RFM score: 255
Count: 71 customers
Recency (Mean): 330.23 days
Frequency (Mean): 15.93 purchases
Monetary (Mean): £8,355.68

Marketing Strategy: Former power users now silent for nearly a year. High risk of permanent churn. Use aggressive win-back offers like deep discounts or exclusive gifts. Identify if a service issue or competitor caused the departure.

3. Hibernating
Exact Stats:
RFM score: 212
Count: 1,523 customers
Recency (Mean): 458.28 days
Frequency (Mean): 1.25 purchases
Monetary (Mean): £438.03

Marketing Strategy: Largest group but lowest engagement and value. Inactive for over 15 months. Minimize marketing spend. Use automated email sequences or bulk seasonal promotions. If no response to a "last chance" offer, cease resource allocation.

#### Marketing Signficance:
Low Recency Value: Indicates an active, "fresh" customer who has purchased very recently. They should be targeted with loyalty rewards or new product announcements.

High Recency Value: Indicates a customer who has not purchased in a long time. These customers are categorized as "At-Risk" or "Hibernating" and require different strategies, such as aggressive re-engagement discounts, to bring them back to the store.

High Frequency: Suggests a "Habitual Buyer" or a reliable wholesaler who has integrated LGS into their own supply chain. The marketing team should offer "Frequency Incentives," such as a loyalty card or a "Buy 5, Get 10% Off Your 6th Order" promotion to push them into the high-frequency category.

Low Frequency: Suggests "One-off" gift buyers or new customers who have not yet committed to the brand. These customers need "Welcome Back" education. Send them content about the variety of products LGS offers to show that the shop isn't just for one specific occasion.

For High Monetary: LGS should provide "White Glove Service." This includes dedicated account managers, early access to new stock, or bulk-buy discounts that aren't available to the general public.

For Low Monetary: The goal here is to increase the Average Order Value (AOV). The marketing team can use "Upsell" strategies, such as "Free shipping on orders over £50" or "Recommended Add-ons" during the checkout process.

By categorizing customers into segments like "Champions" or "At-Risk," I provide the marketing team with the exact list of users who need either loyalty rewards or re-engagement discounts. Additionally, my analysis of monthly sales growth and user retention patterns helps LGS identify which seasons or product types are underperforming.

## Improvements
Real-time Integration: Transition from static SQL/CSV dumps to a live data stream from the LGS Azure environment using Azure Data Factory for up-to-the-minute marketing insights.


Predictive Analytics: Implement Machine Learning models to forecast future sales and predict customer churn, allowing the marketing team to act before a high-value wholesaler leaves.

Automated Visualization: Deploy an interactive Power BI or Streamlit dashboard so the LGS marketing team can explore the data themselves without needing to run code.
