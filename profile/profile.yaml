# Introduce yourself, your academic and professional background.
# What excites you about the software industry and your passion. At least 80 words
summary: I am a Software Developer and Data Analyst with an academic foundation consisting of an Honours Bachelor of Technology in Software Development and a Computer Programming Diploma from Seneca Polytechnic, alongside an Electrical Engineering Diploma from Georgian College. Professionally, I increased data reporting speed by 85% at Ontario Public Services by engineering Python automation scripts , and I built Kotlin-based mobile features and Adobe Analytics integrations as an Android Developer at CIBC. My experience extends to Claret Asset Management, where I modernized infrastructure by migrating legacy SSIS workflows to Python ETL pipelines on Azure , and Canada's Wonderland, where I secured network infrastructure and maintained over 2,000 POS endpoints.

    description: The Jarvis Remote Host Monitoring Agent is a professional-grade, agent-based infrastructure monitoring system designed to automate the collection of hardware specifications and real-time resource telemetry from distributed Linux servers. By deploying lightweight Bash scripts on individual nodes, the system continuously pushes critical metricssuch as CPU, memory, and disk utilizationto a centralized PostgreSQL database hosted within Docker. This architecture eliminates the need for manual checks by utilizing Cron-based automation and SQL analytics, empowering System Administrators and DevOps Engineers to proactively monitor server health, identify performance bottlenecks, and drive informed scaling decisions through data-driven insights.
